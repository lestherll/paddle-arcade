# Paddle Arcade

This is my take on the classic pong game using python and arcade library. The game is basic, catch the ball with the paddle until either one of the player loses. The game only supports 2-Player game for now.

## Dependencies
- python3
- arcade

## Usage
1. Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/lestherll/paddle-arcade.git`
2. Execute `cd paddle-arcade`
3. Run `python3 main.py`

## Future
- Game history using database
- Better menu system
- Better User experience
